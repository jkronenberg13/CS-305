Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.  Who was the client?  What issue did the company want you to address?

A consulting firm called Artemis Financial focuses on creating customized financial plans for its customers.  Their financial plans cover topics like investments, retirement, savings, and insurance.  They are working with Global Rain to update their processes, and one of the ways they plan to do so is by utilizing a RESTful web application programming interface (API).  Improving the security of Artemis Financial's operations is their top priority.  Their goal is to locate any possible security holes in their web application.  The aim is to generate a vulnerability assessment report after thoroughly evaluating the application for possible threats and weaknesses.  This report will act as a guide for putting security measures in place that will effectively mitigate any vulnerabilities found and protect sensitive financial data and Artemis Financial's software from outside threats.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?  Why is it important to code securely?  What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully used Maven to scan for potential vulnerabilities while I was trying to find security flaws in the client's software.  This gave me the opportunity to use automated tools to fully analyze the software's dependencies and find any security flaws.  I carried out a manual code review in addition to using Maven.  This involved looking over the entire codebase of the program, including the API that was integrated into it.  With the help of this practical approach, I was able to locate potential points of entry for vulnerabilities, examine coding patterns, and find any serious security flaws that automated tools might have missed.  A thorough evaluation was ensured by combining the strength of Maven's automated vulnerability scanning with manual code reviews.  Although automated tools are effective in locating known vulnerabilities, manual reviews offer the necessary context to find more subtle security flaws that may be caused by custom code or unusual usage scenarios.  I increased the possibility of finding a variety of security flaws, from widely used exploits to more complex and application-specific flaws, by combining the two methods.  Using a hybrid approach, I was able to give the client a comprehensive vulnerability assessment report that guides effective mitigation strategies by providing a comprehensive view of potential threats. 


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The vulnerability assessment process offered opportunities for valuable learning as well as challenges.  Specifically, coming up with workable ways to fix the vulnerabilities that were found proved to be difficult.  Although the evaluation identified potential security flaws, it took considerable thought and experience to identify the best and most effective ways to address these vulnerabilities.  Certain vulnerabilities may not have simple fixes, requiring ingenuity in problem-solving and a thorough comprehension of the architecture of the software.
How did you increase layers of security?  In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I devised a thorough plan that included SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) implementation to strengthen security measures.  SHA256 employs a combination of hardware and software elements to improve the security of confidential information and prevent unwanted access.  Through the integration of the SHA256 encryption technique, an additional layer of protection against potential threats was introduced.  Because of this extra complexity, it is noticeably harder for hostile actors to compromise the software's security and obtain private data.  I would continue to use a combination of automated tools and manual reviews, as well as incorporate industry best practices, to assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques in the future.  Automated vulnerability scanning tools, such as security scanners or Maven, are very helpful in finding common vulnerabilities quickly and effectively.  But I would also stress how crucial manual code reviews are for identifying subtle vulnerabilities and resolving issues unique to a custom application.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?  After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I first ran the program to make sure it worked and to look for any runtime issues or irregularities that might have affected how well it performed.  Through program execution and scenario modeling, I was able to verify that the software fulfilled its intended requirements and performed as anticipated.  After SHA256 encryption was put into place, I added a checksum generation procedure for security.  This required encrypting data and then producing a checksum.  I could determine whether the encryption function worked as intended and whether the data remained unaltered during the encryption and decryption processes by looking up the checksum.  This step offered a means of confirming that data corruption or inconsistencies were not introduced by the encryption.  I thoroughly tested the regression after refactoring the code.  The functional and security tests had to be rerun on the restructured codebase to find any additional vulnerabilities that might have surfaced because of the code modifications.  These tests' results were compared to the pre-refactoring results to find any inconsistencies or potential security holes caused by the code modifications. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Knowing how to use Maven to find vulnerabilities in a codebase is a useful skill that will come in handy for upcoming projects.  By streamlining the process of looking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, this tool improves the effectiveness of security assessments.  Similar vulnerability scanning tools can be very helpful in spotting potential flaws and guaranteeing the robustness of software.  Any software application can be made much more secure by implementing secure coding practices, such as input validation, appropriate authorization and authentication procedures, and careful error handling.  Building secure and resilient software from the ground up can be achieved by implementing these practices in subsequent assignments.  One useful technique for ensuring data integrity after encryption is the practice of generating checksums.  By using checksum verification, data transformations can be verified and errors or corruption in the encryption process can be prevented.  This procedure can be expanded to verify data integrity in different contexts.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience.  What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I can present both the original codebase and the improved, security-added version.  I can demonstrate my coding prowess in implementing secure practices, like encryption and checksum verification, to safeguard sensitive data and strengthen the software against potential threats by comparing the two versions.  I can talk about how I use Maven to find vulnerabilities.  Describe how I used this tool to check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the software.  This demonstrates how I use contemporary development tools to improve security procedures and lower possible risks.  I can furnish instances of test strategies, scenarios, and outcomes that are employed to verify the software application's security and functionality.  These artifacts demonstrate my methodical testing methodology and my commitment to guaranteeing the dependability and security of the software.
